# Tools

This document describes the setup tools to build, package and deploy strucenglib
on linux. All dependencies are captured in the provided vagrant box. Install vagrant as described in /tools/vagrant.
The script distrib.sh captures common deployment commands with dotnet and yak.exe


## Distrib Tool
```sh
distrib.sh: ./distrib.sh {update_version|version|build|package|deploy_test|deploy|distrib|distrib_test}
commands: 
  update_version <version>.....: updates version
  version......................: list version
  build........................: build dotnet solution
  package......................: builds solution, creates yak package format
  deploy_test..................: deploys the yak package to test store
  deploy.......................: deploys the yak package to store
  distrib......................: builds, packages, deploys package to store
  distrib_test.................: builds, packages, deploys package to test store
```

Ensure that environment variable `YAK_TOKEN` is set. Set token in ./distrib.env.

``` sh
export YAK_TOKEN=...
```

The yak_token can be obtained with yak.exe login.  
- On Windows: %AppData%\Roaming\McNeel\yak.yml
- On Linux: mono/pwsh yak.exe login (needs xserver for browser login)

## Build
```sh
# boot vagrant and login
cd /project/root/dir
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# cd into distrib tools
cd /vagrant/tools/distrib

# build the dotnet solution
./distrib.sh build
./distrib.sh test

# Package yak format
./distrib.sh package
```
The built Rhino plugin can susequently be found in `/StrucEngLib/bin/Debug/net48/`.
The yak package can be found in `./build`

## Publish to Rhino Store
Log into yak with yak.exe login. Your mcneel account must be connected with
strucenglib.

```sh
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/tools/distrib
mono yak.exe login
```
Copy token obtained from login into distrib.env or export YAK_TOKEN into the environment.

```
# from yak.exe login
http://localhost:5123/mcneel#state=<state>&token=<copy this token>
export YAK_TOKEN=<token>
```


Publish to test store
```sh
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/tools/distrib
./distrib package
./distrib.sh distrib_test
```

Publish to store
```sh
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/tools/distrib
./distrib package
./distrib.sh distrib
```

## Test Builds

In order to install builds deployed with `distrib.sh distrib_test|deploy_test`, the test store in Rhino must be enabled. In Rhino, access Options/Tools/Advanced/ and add the value `https://test.yak.rhino3d.com` to the property `Rhino.Options.PackageManager.Sources` (use semicolon as separator).
